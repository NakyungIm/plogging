## Inspiration
Plogging—picking up litter while jogging or walking—offers a unique and enjoyable way to exercise while giving back to the environment. It’s a meaningful activity that combines personal health benefits with a positive impact on the community and planet.

However, we noticed that many people face challenges when it comes to correctly classifying waste and disposing of it in the appropriate bins. To address this issue and enhance the plogging experience, we are developing a website designed to guide users on waste classification while motivating them to stay active.

Our goal is to inspire healthier lifestyles and empower individuals to make a tangible difference in creating cleaner, greener communities, one step at a time.

## What it can do
WePlog is a platform focusing on making every exercise more purposeful, enjoyable and meaningful. Exercising with Weplog, you can record your workout by recording the time spent, distance covered and the specific number of the litter items collected during each session.

In addition, as a helpful waste classification assistanant, WePlog enables you to upload pictures of litter and identifies the correct bin for proper disposal by integrated with advanced AI.

## How we built
For the frontend, React.js was utilized to construct dynamic and visually appealing website modules. We used Node.js as the backend to handle server-side functionality, MySQL for storing user information and logging records,and an OPENAI model to classsify litter objects in the uploaded photos.
